# Pastebin-Lite

## Project Description
Pastebin-Lite is a simple web application that allows users to create text pastes and share them using a unique URL.  
Each paste can optionally expire based on time (TTL) or a maximum view count. Once any constraint is triggered, the paste becomes unavailable.

The project is built using **Next.js** for the frontend and **Express.js** with **MongoDB** for the backend and data persistence.
